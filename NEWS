version 2.0 final (18-September-2020):
	* Updated to work with modern versions of virtualenv.

	  Modern versions of virtualenv have a lot of new machinery to set up a
	  virtualenv and to store configuration. There were a lot of complications
	  to sort out from this, but virtualenv-multiver should now be more
	  future-proof as a result. If you hit any issues, please let us know.

	  Older versions of virtualenv should still be supported.

	* The order of Python versions passed to virtualenv-multiver no longer
	  matters.

	  It used to be that the order impacted which version of Python the
	  `python` and `pip` scripts would link to. Now the versions are sorted
	  and scripts, symlinks, and binaries are generated with more care.


version 1.0 final (5-September-2020):
	* Added support for creating a virtualenv on pypy.

	* Fixed an issue patching the Python binaries when not using a
	  system-provided version of Python on macOS.


version 0.5.0 final (28-June-2015):
	* First public release.
